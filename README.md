This is to provision the AWS Infra i.e. EKS Cluster on AWS Environment.

To Setup your own infra, you need to make the following changes in the repository:

1. Look for account.hcl file and update your account_id and account_region.
2. Look for environments/dev folder and rename the skillupwithsachin-eks-demo cluster name to your choice and also update the terragrunt.hcl with the subnet-id's.
3. We are using defualt vpc and subnet-id here so you can use the same.
4. You need to create the OIDC provider in AWS IAM under Identity Provider for the github, please add Provider as : token.actions.githubusercontent.com and  Audience: sts.amazonaws.com
5. You need to create IAM role to run the github actions i.e. <cluster-name>-gha-terraform-svc-role" with the IAM Trust Policy and Permissions as Power User and IAMFullAccess permissions.
